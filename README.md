# Face-Mask-Detection-System
This program, which is connected to a webcam situated on the door, captures the video, detects faces and checks whether the faces have a mask on. The software also consists of a Graphical User Interface (GUI), which notifies users inside the house about the detections and sends appropriate messages. 
Uses OpenCV, Keras and Deep Learning. 
Deployed this software in my apartment for real time testing.
